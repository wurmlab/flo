# flo - basic gff annotations lift over using chain files

Lift over is a way of mapping annotations from one genome assembly to another.
The idea "lift over" is same as what tools like UCSC LiftOver, NCBI's LiftUp
web service do. However, NCBI and UCSC's webs services are available only for
a limited number of species.

To perform lift over locally, one can use UCSC chain files ([Kent et al 2003][kent2003])
with programs such as UCSC's liftOver or [CrossMap][crossmap]. A chain file captures
large, homologous segments between two genomes as chains of gapless blocks of
alignment. One way of generating chain files is using [this bash script][kent-script]
and [UCSC tools][ucsc-tools].

flo is an implementation of the above script in Ruby programming language. Further,
both liftOver and CrossMap process GFF files line by line instead of transcripts as
a whole. This results in some non-biologically meaningful output. flo provides a
basic filtering of UCSC liftOver's GFF output.

## Using flo

To use flo you must have Ruby 2.0 or higher and the BioRuby gem. Ruby 2.0 can
be installed through package managers on Linux and is available by default on
Mac. To install BioRuby gem:

    sudo gem install bio

flo additionally requires a few programs from [UCSC tools][ucsc-tools], [GNU
Parallel][gnu-parallel] and [genometools][genometools]. These can be
installed in any directory by running 'scripts/install.sh' script
after you have downloaded flo:

    wget -c https://github.com/yeban/flo/archive/master.tar.gz -O flo.tar.gz
    tar xvf flo.tar.gz
    mv flo-master flo

It's best to run flo in a new directory - we will call it project dir:

    mkdir flo_species_name
    cd flo_species_name

Copy over example configuration file from where you installed flo to
project dir:

    cp /path/to/flo/opts_example.yaml opts.yaml

Install flo's dependencies in `ext/` directory in the project dir:

    /path/to/flo/scripts/install.sh

Now edit `opts.yaml` to indicate the location of source and target assembly in
FASTA format (required), location of GFF3 file(s) containing annotations on
the source assembly (optional - if you omit this, flo will stop after
generating the chain file) and number of CPU cores to use (required).

Finally, run flo as:

    rake -f /path/to/flo/Rakefile

This will generate a directory corresponding to each GFF file (if provided):
"input_gff_name-liftover-target_assembly_name". The above dir contains a
similarly named GFF file which is the final output.

The chain file generated by flo can be found at 'run/liftover.chn'.

## Results & discussion
Both strengths and weaknesses of flo largely reflect that of the underlying
tools - the chain file and UCSC liftOver. In general, gaps and errors in
assemblies may split a long chain. Gene models that are split across
different chains as well as those that are duplicated in the target
assembly are not lifted.

- For an ant genome (~350 Mb) we saw 90% annotations map identically to
the new assembly (unpublished result).
- flo has been used in [First draft assembly and annotation of the
genome of a California Endemic Oak _Quercus lobata_ Née (Fagaceae).
Sork et al 2016. G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics 6(11): 3485-3495.](https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.116.030411)

## Tweak flo
If you would like to optimise how chain files are created:
- UCSC wiki and website is an amazing resource to learn about BLAT and
  chain files. Don't forget to read Kent 2003 paper cited above first.
- Read the `Rakefile` from top to bottom. Ruby is similar, yet simpler
  compared to Perl and bash.

You can test things by lifting annotations between the same assembly.
