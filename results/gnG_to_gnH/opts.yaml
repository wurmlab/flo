# These will be added to PATH before the pipeline is run. The paths below

# Location of source and target assemblies.

# If migrating annotations from assembly A to assembly B, A is the source
# and B is the target. Source and target assemblies are specified as path
# to the corresponding FASTA files (must end in .fa).

# Number of processes that will be used to parallelise flo. Ideally, this
# will be the number of CPU cores you have.
:processes: '40'

# Parameters to run BLAT with.
#
# In addition to the options specified here, -noHead option is set by flo.
# -noHead simply causes the output BLAT output files to not have a header.
# It doesn't impact accuracy of results.

# Empty string is equivalent to:

#   -minScore=30 -minIdentity=90 -maxGap=2 -maxIntron=75000
#
# The default string defined below is a suitable trade-off between running
# time and sensitivity.
